      <p><strong>Italy</strong> Officially the Italian Republic (Italian: Repubblica italiana),[8][9][10][11] is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.[note 1] Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of 301,338 km2 (116,347 sq mi) and has a largely temperate seasonal and Mediterranean climate. Due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as lo Stivale (the Boot).[12][13] With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.</p>
